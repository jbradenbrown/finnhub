# Finnhub Rust API Client Architecture

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Rust client library for the Finnhub.io financial data API. The library is built using modern Rust patterns with async/await support via Tokio and HTTP requests via reqwest.

## Key Features

- **Full API Coverage**: Implements all 107 endpoints from the Finnhub API
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed request/response models derived from OpenAPI spec
- **Async/Await**: Built on Tokio for high-performance async operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiter respecting 30 requests/second limit
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with detailed context
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time data streaming capabilities
- **Modular Design**: Organized by API categories for maintainability

### Design Principles

1. **Builder Pattern**: Use builder pattern for complex requests
2. **Result Types**: All API calls return `Result<T, FinnhubError>`
3. **Zero-Copy Deserialization**: Use serde with borrowed data where possible
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections via reqwest
5. **Configurable Client**: Allow customization of timeouts, retries, etc.

### Client Architecture

```rust
pub struct FinnhubClient {
    api_key: String,
    http_client: reqwest::Client,
    rate_limiter: RateLimiter,
    base_url: String,
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum FinnhubError {
    #[error("HTTP error: {0}")]
    Http(#[from] reqwest::Error),
    
    #[error("Rate limit exceeded")]
    RateLimitExceeded,
    
    #[error("Invalid API key")]
    Unauthorized,
    
    #[error("API error: {message}")]
    ApiError { message: String, code: u16 },
    
    #[error("Deserialization error: {0}")]
    Deserialization(#[from] serde_json::Error),
}
```

### Rate Limiting Design

- Token bucket algorithm with 30 tokens/second
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Configurable burst capacity
- Per-client rate limiting

### Authentication Methods

1. **URL Parameter**: `?token=API_KEY`
2. **Header**: `X-Finnhub-Token: API_KEY`

The library will use header-based auth by default for security.

## Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
thiserror = "1"
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
url = "2"
futures = "0.3"
tokio-tungstenite = "0.20"  # For WebSocket
tracing = "0.1"
tower = { version = "0.4", features = ["limit", "retry"] }

[dev-dependencies]
tokio-test = "0.4"
wiremock = "0.5"
criterion = "0.5"
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test against mock Finnhub API
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Optional tests against real API (requires API key)
4. **Property-based Tests**: Use proptest for edge cases

## Performance Considerations

1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTPS connections
2. **Response Streaming**: Stream large responses
3. **Parallel Requests**: Support concurrent API calls
4. **Caching**: Optional response caching layer
5. **Zero-Copy**: Minimize allocations in hot paths

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage**: Never log or expose API keys
2. **HTTPS Only**: Enforce TLS for all connections
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Error Messages**: Don't leak sensitive info in errors

## Development Workflow

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - `main`: Stable releases
   - `develop`: Integration branch
   - `feature/*`: Feature branches
   - `fix/*`: Bug fix branches

2. **Commit Convention**:
   - `feat:` New features
   - `fix:` Bug fixes
   - `docs:` Documentation
   - `test:` Tests
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `perf:` Performance improvements

3. **Quality Checks**:
   - Run `cargo fmt` before commits
   - Run `cargo clippy` for lints
   - Run `cargo test` for all tests
   - Check documentation with `cargo doc`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Async Trait Support**: When stable
2. **Compile-time API Validation**: Macro-based endpoint generation
3. **WASM Support**: For browser usage
4. **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for the API
5. **Response Middleware**: Pluggable response processing
6. **Metrics & Telemetry**: OpenTelemetry integration

## Release Plan

1. **v0.1.0**: Core client with stock endpoints
2. **v0.2.0**: Add forex, crypto, indices
3. **v0.3.0**: Add alternative data endpoints
4. **v0.4.0**: WebSocket support
5. **v1.0.0**: Stable API with all features
