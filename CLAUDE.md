# Finnhub Rust API Client Architecture

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Rust client library for the Finnhub.io financial data API. The library is built using modern Rust patterns with async/await support via Tokio and HTTP requests via reqwest.

## Key Features

- **Full API Coverage**: Implements all 107 endpoints from the Finnhub API
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed request/response models derived from OpenAPI spec
- **Async/Await**: Built on Tokio for high-performance async operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiter respecting 30 requests/second limit
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with detailed context
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time data streaming capabilities
- **Modular Design**: Organized by API categories for maintainability

### Design Principles

1. **Builder Pattern**: Use builder pattern for complex requests
2. **Result Types**: All API calls return `Result<T, FinnhubError>`
3. **Zero-Copy Deserialization**: Use serde with borrowed data where possible
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections via reqwest
5. **Configurable Client**: Allow customization of timeouts, retries, etc.

### Client Architecture

```rust
pub struct FinnhubClient {
    api_key: String,
    http_client: reqwest::Client,
    rate_limiter: RateLimiter,
    base_url: String,
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum Error {
    #[error("HTTP error: {0}")]
    Http(#[from] reqwest::Error),
    
    #[error("Rate limit exceeded: please retry after {retry_after} seconds")]
    RateLimitExceeded { retry_after: u64 },
    
    #[error("Unauthorized: invalid API key")]
    Unauthorized,
    
    #[error("API error (status {status}): {message}")]
    ApiError { status: u16, message: String },
    
    #[error("Deserialization error: {0}")]
    Deserialization(#[from] serde_json::Error),
    
    #[error("Invalid parameter: {0}")]
    InvalidParameter(String),
    
    #[error("Invalid request: {0}")]
    InvalidRequest(String),
}
```

### Rate Limiting Design

- Token bucket algorithm with 30 tokens/second
- Two strategies: Standard (default) and FifteenSecondWindow (for batch processing)
- Standard: 30 requests/second with 2-second burst capacity (60 tokens)
- FifteenSecondWindow: 450 requests/15 seconds for batch operations
- Per-client rate limiting (no shared rate limiters between clients)

### Authentication Methods

1. **URL Parameter**: `?token=API_KEY`
2. **Header**: `X-Finnhub-Token: API_KEY`

The library uses header authentication by default (`X-Finnhub-Token`) for better security. Both header and URL parameter authentication (`?token=API_KEY`) are supported by Finnhub for all GET requests.

## Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.40", features = ["full"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.12", features = ["json", "rustls-tls"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
thiserror = "1.0"
chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
url = "2.5"
futures = "0.3"
tokio-tungstenite = { version = "0.24", optional = true }  # For WebSocket
tracing = "0.1"
tower = { version = "0.5", features = ["limit", "retry", "timeout"] }
async-trait = "0.1"

[dev-dependencies]
tokio-test = "0.4"
criterion = { version = "0.5", features = ["html_reports"] }
pretty_assertions = "1.4"
proptest = "1.5"
dotenv = "0.15"
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: 101 tests across 24 modules testing individual endpoints
2. **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive API tests validating real API responses
3. **Rate Limit Tests**: Multiple test suites validating rate limiting behavior
4. **Model Validation**: Tests ensure correct parsing of API responses
5. **Property-based Tests**: Using proptest for edge cases

Note: Each unit test creates its own client instance with its own rate limiter. Rate limiters are not shared between tests, which could potentially exceed API rate limits when tests run in parallel.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTPS connections
2. **Response Streaming**: Stream large responses
3. **Parallel Requests**: Support concurrent API calls
4. **Caching**: Optional response caching layer
5. **Zero-Copy**: Minimize allocations in hot paths

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage**: Never log or expose API keys
2. **HTTPS Only**: Enforce TLS for all connections
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Error Messages**: Don't leak sensitive info in errors

## Development Workflow

1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - `main`: Stable releases
   - `develop`: Integration branch
   - `feature/*`: Feature branches
   - `fix/*`: Bug fix branches

2. **Commit Convention**:
   - `feat:` New features
   - `fix:` Bug fixes
   - `docs:` Documentation
   - `test:` Tests
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `perf:` Performance improvements

3. **Quality Checks**:
   - Run `cargo fmt` before commits
   - Run `cargo clippy` for lints
   - Run `cargo test` for all tests
   - Check documentation with `cargo doc`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Async Trait Support**: When stable
2. **Compile-time API Validation**: Macro-based endpoint generation
3. **WASM Support**: For browser usage
4. **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for the API
5. **Response Middleware**: Pluggable response processing
6. **Metrics & Telemetry**: OpenTelemetry integration

## Release Plan

1. **v0.1.0**: Core client with stock endpoints
2. **v0.2.0**: Add forex, crypto, indices
3. **v0.3.0**: Add alternative data endpoints
4. **v0.4.0**: WebSocket support
5. **v1.0.0**: Stable API with all features
